# GAN

Experimenting with the design and applications of generative adversial 
networks detailed from Ian Goodfellow's seminal paper [link](https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661).

This framework is built to be modularized for facilitating easy creation and training
of generative/discriminative network pairs across different usecases.
